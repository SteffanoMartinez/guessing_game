# guessing_game

This project was pulled directly from the Rust Documentation page : https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html

The topics learned here where:
 
 -Creation of variables (mutable and unmutable)
 -Inputs
 -Use of dependencies and crates
 -Error hanlding 
 -Match statements (branching)
 -Typecasting
 -Loops
 
 The scope of the project is to get the programmer exposed to some dependencies management and use of some syntax. 
 
 An ongoing Notion is being used to store learned skills: https://safe-hamster-28f.notion.site/Rust-0c9aa135859443f89c31f8bbea98d6d6
